I was unsuccessful in getting mail from Riemann. The log files also does not show any errors, I have tested the clj file with both 465 and 587 port but the situation remains the same.
I have mailutils installed and my host can send mail email. I tested it using the command  echo "This is a test" | mail -s "Test" manand1@hawk.ii t.edu and I am attaching a screenshot of it.

I am working further on this to have Riemann send me the emails.
